<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>	Scalar is an open source, free publishing platform designed for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online. The tool enables the users to build media by multiple sources and combine them with their own writing in a variety of ways (Scalar, 2016). This can be considered a Digital Humanities project, as well as Digital Scholarship because the tool allows the user to publish scholarly text in a variety of creative and interactive ways. For example videos, charts, links, and so much more can be added because in Scalar, “anything can do everything to anything” (Scalar, 2016).
<h2>Collaboration Statement</h2> 
<p>Using collaborative scholarship for this project was helpful when splitting up the work, and helpful to the team member knowledge of the topic as well. Our group presented "Scalar", though we all had different parts, the team had the same understanding as to what the website does by interacting and trying it out. There was some confusion at first on my part, but I quickly found a solution and now have a better understanding of the topic.</p>

you use when working in a team? How do you situate collaborative research within the digital
humanities—how does collaboration, as you approach it, advance your stated research agenda?
